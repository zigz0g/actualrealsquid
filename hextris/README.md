# Hextris Lite

Hextris is an amazingly great open source game.
The original authors deserve massive credit for creating
such an enjoyable game, and even more credit for 
releasing the game under the GNU General Public License.

But ...

Hextris now has a massive problem.

The maintainers of the original Hextris github repository made a _conscious decision_
to add a trojan javascript miner (`Trojan:JS/CoinHive.B`) into the Hextris code.

The ethical implications are profoundly troubling.

As such, the Attogram Project has forked the original Hextris repository
and created **Hextris Lite**.

The goal of **Hextris Lite** is to deliver a fully playable Hextris game
with absolutely nothing extra.   

No trojan javascript miners.

No social media buttons.

No analytics scripts.

No web bugs.

No marketing and publicity javascript libraries.

Nothing but the game.

Enjoy.
